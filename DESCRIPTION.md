# Description

Randomize palettes in Link to the Past multiworld.

## Philosophy

The purpose of this project is to provide a configurable palette randomizer for
The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. I built this because the current
randomizer did not account for certain colors existing in many different palette
regions and you would get some tiles like grass or or water having different
colors and looking disconnected.

## Open Source

This project is being built with the goal of being completely open source, and
enforcing all programs that use it be open source too. Open source allows anyone
to contribute, fix, and improve the project at any time. It also allows anyone
to use the project for their own purposes.

For more information on the value of open source, read the
[Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/).

## Cross platform

In conjunction with open source, being cross platform is an essential component
of this project; it should be accessible to anyone on any OS. Making
cross-platform projects also becomes easier for open source projects where users
with different setups can contribute.

## Full documentation

Sometimes, the biggest challenge of contributing to a new project is
understanding what all of the code does. For this reason, it is our philosophy
that every function, module, and component be documented and outlined, and have
relevant example code to show users how its used and why.

In practice, this doesn't always work out. We gladly welcome any inquiries or
contributions to code documentation.

## Community driven environment

Please follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for a more detailed
explanation of working in a community project.

## Accessibility

As a quick and general rule, be sure to

- Use resource files in place of hardcoded strings.
- Use culture-specific settings where appropriate.
- Handle dates and times according to the user's locale.
